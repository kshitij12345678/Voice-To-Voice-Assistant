User: Hi. Hey. So I'm Yash and I'm 24 years old. My problem is like first yesterday when I was eating the ice cream, I had the sensitivity problem. So I felt it in my tooth like one or two tooth I felt very much sensitive but like the incisors I didn't feel that much.
Response: So how long have you been feeling sensitive? Did you notice it any time before?

User: No, no, no. It's like one week before I haven't noticed it. Yesterday when I was in the college and I tasted it after one week, then I felt it.

User: In like in these canine tooth I felt it. Maybe it is because of that I have skipped brushes two days.
Response: Because of the sensitivity?
[Emotion: Questioning] [Tone: Neutral]

=== Document ID: 5 ===
User: No, because like brush I have just done it with my fingers. Maybe because of that I didn't clean it properly. Toothpaste I used but I didn't use the brush.
Response: But you know because you are telling it as a sensitivity, it doesn't come or develop overnight. (Serious) It might be due to you know some long-standing maybe minor issue that's been there but you didn't notice it. (Technical) Generally also if there is tooth pain or something that the damage would have been developing for quite a long time. So how regularly do you go to dentist for a checkup or where? Okay. When was the last time that you went?

[Emotion: Summarizing] [Tone: Neutral]

=== Document ID: 14 ===
User: Yeah. It's been a year.
Response: So the two reasons is that like how regularly you have to, I mean you avoided using toothbrush.
[Emotion: Analyzing] [Tone: Neutral]

=== Document ID: 15 ===
User: No. I don't avoid toothbrush but I use soft toothbrush. That's my thing. Like very gentle toothbrush I can only use. I don't use hard toothbrush. Else I will feel little bit too much harsh on the teeth.
Response: Okay. So that was the only time you faced sensitivity even after that you tried to eat anything cold or something?
[Emotion: Questioning] [Tone: Neutral]

=== Document ID: 16 ===
User: That was yesterday only. After that I, cold things I don't have problem with the liquid but with this ice cream only I had this very.
Response: But that was the only once?
[Emotion: Confirming] [Tone: Neutral]

=== Document ID: 17 ===
User: That's the only once when I noticed it. Before that I ate one week before I haven't had anything.
Response: So from all your dental history and you know your oral hygiene. (Advising) Oral hygiene habits and all. Probably it could have been an acute pain because you didn't recur also. Because the ice cream might have been also like super cold. But because you have faced sensitivity it can be fixed with small remedies for now. (Explaining) Else you know acute sensation for the gum as in there because of temperature changes. Because see if the temperature is very hot also there might be a little damage of tissue which might have caused the pain. So in the same way because of the extreme temperatures the body might have reacted like that. But regular brushing will definitely help. As suggested in your clinic previously. It's good to get teeth cleaned. At the age of 20 to 24 usually the growth stops and bone also starts getting hardened. So from that age it is good to have these regular cleaning check ups. Getting scaling done. Which will also improve your gums health. Then the normal foot blotchment that happens which might not always go away with brushing or gargling. This cleaning will help remove those debris. Or food that is lost in the deeper parts of your teeth. So yeah that will help you and avoid future problems like this.

User: So is it maybe because of this like I have changed my toothpaste also? First I was using Sensodyne since like one and a half year. And then recently I switched to Colgate.
Response: Okay. Now who suggested and why it is suggested. Why did you pick up using Sensodyne?
[Emotion: Inquiring] [Tone: Neutral]

=== Document ID: 19 ===
User: At that time also when I started using Sensodyne I felt the sensitivity problem. Then I switched to Sensodyne and I didn’t feel any problem.
Response: Usually sensitivity correction toothpaste are like medication. (Advising) Just because you feel comfortable using them doesn't mean it fixes the root cause. When the body gets habituated to these things... You need to be careful of long-term use. So because now you have stopped it you might feel discomfort. But again body will revive and start defending. So yeah use the normal toothpaste only.

User: So, my name is Ankush. Today, I am here for the first time. I am coming to a dentist because I haven't been to a dentist before. I haven't faced any problem like tooth decay or any other problem due to teeth. So, one thing is, I am a bit scared of going to a dentist. Like, what if some problem comes and how will it be treated? And something like painful things and all. So, what is your advice that you would give to a patient who is nervous?
Response: Okay, so, as then most of the people are apprehensive about or worried about dental issues. But the first thing is, as you take care of your health, the general health of your entire body. So, teeth are also part of our entire body system. So, it is equally good to take care of your dental health in a periodic way. So, yeah, generally, maybe because of your previous experiences or something, or maybe if you have heard from many of your friends or family of some painful procedures, that might not apply to everyone. (Advising) Going for regular checkups will help you to prevent problems. So, prevention is always better than cure, and you know, undergoing all those procedures. So, coming regularly, six-monthly or three-monthly for just a checkup will avoid all those painful and stressful things that you might face in the future.

User: So, one normal situation, not related to me, like, at what times do dentists use injections? Injections.
Response: In dental procedures, usually, the injections are given to extract teeth and when there is root canal treatment, that is happening, especially to your illness. Yes, that is for numbness only. So, it works like any other local anesthesia. (Technical) Anesthesia. Yeah, so that it will prevent the patient from experiencing the pain by giving numbness. Okay, so anything else instead of injection, like which helps the patient to relax and then they are feeling the pain or discomfort? Yeah, so previously it was not there, but very recently, like maybe some 5 to 6 years back, there were these local anesthesia sprays that are given. So, the injection that is given is for it—the medicine should reach the nerve to develop numbness around that area. But even before that, the pain will start because the needle of the syringe pricks the gums. Even to make the entire gums numb, the spray is given. So, that even that prick is also not felt. So, this will give a zero-pain injection or maybe very minimal pain. It has anesthesia also. And that spray also has the same anesthesia, but it is sprayed outside. It doesn't reach the nerve, but it is just for the tissue outside.

User: Okay. So, one question: I am in my 20s, 24 years old. So, I have wisdom teeth, and all are here. I haven't looked at any of them. So, they don't hurt me, but even if they don't hurt me, should I still take them out?
Response: No, no need actually. At the age of like 24 or 25, it takes till 30 or 32 also for all the wisdom teeth to come out. (Explaining) These wisdom teeth are usually half-grown outside or not grown because there might be less space in someone's mouth for those teeth to come out. As such, as you mentioned, though wisdom teeth don't have any functional importance, but if the tooth comes out irregularly or pushes the other teeth to the front or crowds the back, there might be a problem because the normal toothbrush doesn't reach those places. So, the normal cleaning procedures are not enough to maintain the health around those wisdom teeth. So, in the long run, there might be some issues people in general might face with wisdom teeth just because of inaccessibility to hygiene. So, these regular checkups will also allow the dentist to actually assess the health of the wisdom teeth and the tissues around.
[Emotion: Advising] [Tone: Neutral]

=== Document ID: 23 ===
User: Okay, so you mean you are saying regular checkups like so?
Response: Yeah, regular checkups might prevent any person from getting those teeth removed unless it is painful or really disturbing the entire hygiene of the mouth.
[Emotion: Confirming] [Tone: Neutral]

=== Document ID: 24 ===
User: So, what is the time spent for regular checkups, like the correct time?
Response: Six months to one year will do. So, in the first visit, a dentist can estimate how hygienic your mouth is based on your food habits, cleaning habits, drinking, etc. There are different habits that might affect it, and there are also some general body issues that might affect dental health, I can say. The health of the teeth, like if some person is having gastritis, that is gas—all those problems, they keep burping a lot. That burping does tend to bring some gastric acids into the mouth, which also will cause bad breath, erosion of teeth, etc. So, these can be detected early.
[Emotion: Advising] [Tone: Neutral]

=== Document ID: 25 ===
User: Okay, so you like, as you said about eating habits today. So, does eating sugar affect the teeth?
Response: Yeah, in some way, actually, it is not directly affecting as such, like the sugar or any other sticky substances or any food, to that matter. There should be a problem cleaning or rinsing and flossing if needed after every meal or everything the person ate. For example, the sugars in bubble gum and all, with the other materials, they tend to be sticky, the cheese and everything and the oils. So, when that sticky substance gets accommodated on the teeth, it will be easier for the germs to get lodged onto the tooth and also in between the teeth, which will lead to damage or decay of that particular tooth. So, regular cleaning will also help, not just the food habits.
[Emotion: Explaining] [Tone: Neutral]

=== Document ID: 26 ===
User: So, regular cleaning—what I do is after eating anything, I do a gargle with normal mild water, not any, as you said, floss, not like that. So, is it fine, or should I do anything else also?
Response: Yeah, again, see if there is a lot of food lodgement even after cleaning. If some people tend to use toothpicks and all, that means that the food is being lodged in between the teeth, which will—and a visit to a dentist will also help that person to understand if that normal rinsing is enough or not. So, in some cases, the teeth might get overlapped when they are growing; they get overlapped and crowding, and all the positions of the teeth will not be proper. So, the person might not know, but the dentist, after looking at the positioning of the teeth, can help them understand different other habits, like using mouthwash, mouthwash gargles, and any different toothpaste. For example, due to the crowding, if the gums tend to recede—I mean, they usually collapse from the normal height—so that is when the sensitivity arises and all that. So, when detected earlier, the type of toothpaste that is to be used can also be prescribed. If normal toothpaste will do, otherwise, there can be toothpaste with salt content that can help improve a little. If the sensitivity is growing, there are many sensitivity toothpastes which help. Yeah, there are mouthwashes like Listerine, etc.

=== Document ID: 27 ===
User: So, one question is, like, how can I tell that my teeth shape is normal or it needs correction?
Response: Usually, if everything is good and there is no pain and all, it is hard for a normal person to assess if there are very minor issues. But as a dentist, again, if we look at it, we may tell, but a normal person might not understand unless there is pain or some discomfort.
[Emotion: Explaining] [Tone: Neutral]

=== Document ID: 28 ===
User: Okay, discomfort also.
Response: I mean, if they are chewing, though there is no visible infection or something, they may feel pain sometimes. That might be because, you know, the third molar or the—that is growing behind might push the teeth forward. So, that might also cause a little mild pain, or there might be some food lodged that is hard, that is probing and inducing pain. So, there might be multiple factors.
[Emotion: Explaining] [Tone: Neutral]

=== Document ID: 29 ===
User: So, when, like as you said, if there is pain or discomfort, then we can say there is something abnormal in the positioning of the teeth. So, there I have two ways: one is braces and one is veneers.
Response: Veneers are like a plastic covering or casing.
[Emotion: Explaining] [Tone: Neutral]

=== Document ID: 30 ===
User: So, which is better, and like, is there any—if both do the same thing or when what should be used?
Response: Yeah, so yeah, as you said, like both things help in, you know, covering up, I can say, the crowding or overlap or (Technical) misalignment of the teeth. Usually, veneers are mostly used for aesthetic purposes. For example, if there is an actor who has to talk on the screen and mostly their aesthetics are very important. And if they have crowded teeth and all, you know, little bit of adjustments are done, and then a veneer placed on top of it, it acts like a layer to mask the irregularities. It might not completely solve the functional problems that that person is facing. But going for braces or Invisalign-type things, which are coming to the market—that transparent braces kind of thing—will actually adjust and reposition the teeth into the way that they are actually supposed to be, the ideal thing, as close as to the ideal way as possible. Because irregularities will also tend to cause erosion of the teeth; like, the teeth will, you know, the enamel of the teeth will eventually go away, which will make the dentin exposed, and then that also leads to sensitivity and wear. Again, based on the degree of irregularity, the treatment is suggested.

=== Document ID: 31 ===
User: So, one general question: how often should I brush?
Response: It is always a good habit to brush immediately after waking up and even before sleep. After waking up because, I mean, in sleep our salivation will reduce; this will cause dryness in the mouth, which will be—see, saliva has its purpose to help our teeth for self-cleansing. So, during sleep, when it is reduced, the teeth can dry up, and more microbes can be attracted to or settle on the tooth surface, which will cause damage to the tooth. So, immediately after seven to eight hours of sleep, brushing is required, and at the end of the day because we eat so many things, and rinsing or normal gargling might not help completely. Once at the end of the day, again brushing will help.

User: So, if someone has yellow teeth, then what is the process of teeth whitening? Is it artificial, or can it be done naturally also?
Response: Again, the yellowing of the teeth is again in two different phases, like generally. So, one is due to accumulation of (Technical) plaque or calculus, that is called—so, there will be, for a long time, if that person is not cleaning his or her teeth. So, there is sort of accumulation that has been happening over a period, which will harden after some time. Okay, that is called plaque, and even if it gets calcified more, so at first sight, people may think that is a bone growth or something, so it gets that hard. So, that is called calculus. So, these are all to be removed with dental procedures like scaling.
[Emotion: Explaining] [Tone: Neutral]

=== Document ID: 33 ===
User: Okay, so what is that? I didn't get it.
Response: Okay, it's plaque. Plaque. So, it's debris from the food. Okay, okay, that usually gets accumulated around the teeth and other colors. So, that is one reason why teeth can get yellowish. Or, one more reason is, as I told you, there are chances of erosion of enamel in some cases. Due to different things. So, maybe (Technical) malalignment, or maybe for the person who is consuming acidic food like more citrus or more alcohol, so that will cause the removal of the top layer, that is enamel, which is usually white in color. So, the underlying layer is usually yellowish. So, if the white top white layer enamel is being removed, eventually the lower layer will start being shown, so that is the dentin which gives the yellowish color to the teeth. So, when enamel is gone, it can be restored, but there are some artificial procedures like layering. Veneers also is one type of process. No, one layer is yellow, I'm saying. Yeah, yellow part. So, that can be again covered by artificial procedures only.

But after one, two, three sips, when I drink the whole glass, it doesn't affect much. So, what is the reason for that? Like, in the starting, I feel this sensation, and then I just don't know.
Response: Yeah, so again, pain, although after some threshold. I mean, the person doesn't feel it after even crossing beyond the threshold.
[Emotion: Explaining] [Tone: Neutral]

=== Document ID: 35 ===
User: For ice cream also, it happens; like, for one, two, three spoons, I will feel like a great sensation, but then it is okay.
Response: So, it can be either due to increased threshold or maybe the body gets defensive to subside that pain in some other alternate ways. But because the person has already felt that sensitivity, that means there is already an underlying problem that is coming up, that is either again due to erosion of enamel. The enamel is going away due to different reasons, or there might be some gum problems which is making the underlying dentin or roots to get exposed, which are usually to be covered with the gums.
[Emotion: Explaining] [Tone: Neutral]

=== Document ID: 36 ===
User: So, how can I fix it? What should I do?
Response: Yeah, so periodic cleaning or scaling, as I said. See, if there is debris that is being accumulated between tooth and gum, it will eventually cause the under—I mean, it will detach the gums from the tooth. Okay, so it causes pockets, like structures to be formed. So, caving in, we can call it caving in also. The debris, generally, debris is again like some—it is—it is caused by accumulation of food over a period of time. Okay, so it will be whitish or yellowish color which is filled with again these bacteria and all, which causes damage to the tissues. So, those bacteria will keep developing and multiplying, which will tend to grow deeper and deeper into the gums and reach the root of the tooth and cause infection over there. So, in the initial stages, due to—if the person gets, you know, tends to get good oral care and regular cleaning and all, those can be removed. So, that the gums also will get healthy and they protect or do the job that they are intended to do. If it is neglected, then it may lead to infection.

User: So, this is happening with me from so many years, like four or five years, but I am ignoring it. And the threshold, as you said, threshold, you mean like that only, like for one to two sips of water or one to two spoons of ice cream, after that it is fine. So, yeah, the threshold is the same for these four or five years, like one to two sips only. So, should I do anything, or is the threshold the same, and I should ignore it because I am taking good care of my teeth?
Response: Because the pain or sensitivity is still persisting, that means there is extra care that is to be taken. The regular care which you are taking is not enough. That is just stopping it to—yes, that is just—it is, you know, a fix. To get a temporary fix than a permanent solution. Okay, either bearing with the pain or, you know, ignoring that—nothing is there. I know because people are apprehensive to go visit their dentist, thinking that, you know, every procedure is going to be equally painful. But that is not the case. After some time, the infection slowly goes inside, and the damage is far more than anticipated. So, as I mentioned previously, prevention at early stages is better than, you know, going—yeah, taking painful procedures and then looking for a cure. Because this might eventually and slowly accumulate and damage the teeth beyond repair.

User: So, you have practiced before, right?
Response: Yes, yes. So, yeah, the good part again is, you know, being a dentist or a UX designer—solving problems and giving delightful experiences. As you said, not every dentist—you know, I used to have my personal dentist when I was a kid. She used to handle patients so well that they want to keep coming, and they always say that, okay, you have done it very well with minimal pain or with ease. Okay, so that kind of experience even I used to deliver to my patients. Okay, they used to—so that there was one instance where, you know, there was a very old man who was suffering from pain for quite a long time. Just because he couldn't come, he didn't come, but one day he made it to me. I removed his teeth, and because that was the only option, he was like around 90 years old.

User: Yes. So, they should not ignore.
Response: See, when people cross 30, how regularly they go for blood checkups and other health checkups, though there is no underlying problem, just to rule out if there might be something or not. So, people also should understand that dental health also has this historical—I mean, like genetical background. So, at least by seeing, for example, if a family has diabetes. So, the next generations tend to take care of—go for regular checkups. And even for dental caries or dental health, also, there is some family background that usually persists, even the food habits. So, because of that, people should definitely understand and recognize how important it is to take care of their dental health also.

User: Okay. I don't know. I thought it is only about how the teeth are getting to the genes and all. Yeah, so I thought blood issues are there, like—
Response: So, the body, see, with every disease or infection, every person has some ability to fight out the infection, right? Yes. So, even the dental—even the tooth also, you have those nerves and blood vessels supplying the teeth also. Every tooth has that. So, if a body can't fight any infection in any other part, it is the same; it applies to the teeth. So, in the family, if there are people with multiple caries and all, that means the body is unable to give the required protection, or as I mentioned earlier, the saliva helps in self-cleansing. So, if in the family the dry mouth, dryness is existing. So, for them, the saliva produced is not sufficient. So, it will eventually lead to damage of teeth. I mean, rapid damage when compared to other people. So, that can exist; that is hereditary—the amount of saliva or the ability of the body to fight infections. Infections, let it be. So, there will be different substances; eventually, it might cause dental issues.

The impact might be very high which might have caused any disturbance in the teeth or you know some sharp, some sharp, some teeth. Teeth will be sharp right? Yeah. Those teeth also might have you know injured your lower teeth or something. Okay. You might have bitten your gum cheeks or gums in the inside which might also result in pain. Okay. Or there might be some fracture inside your jaw. So these can be addressed if you get an x-ray. So you can get two type of x-rays. One at the place where you are actually getting pain.

=== Document ID: 68 ===
User: Lower jaw.
Response: Only lower jaw?
[Emotion: Confirming] [Tone: Neutral]

=== Document ID: 69 ===
User: Yeah.
Response: Okay. So after checking, probably I think you are having it on both the sides. There might be 2 reasons. One, because you are 21 years and your wisdom teeth might be coming out. So when teeth are erupting, especially wisdom tooth, they tend to push the teeth that are in front of it. So due to that movement, there might be some nagging kind of pain that persists. So you can see that. Okay. So there might be some nagging kind of pain that persists or it might be due to some food debris accumulation and all which needs cleaning. After cleaning is done and if the pain still persists, you know, again we can get a full mouth x-ray that can be done so that it will help me to understand your gums health internally also. Okay. And if they raise any infection and because in the lower jaws, if the wisdom tooth is erupting or it might tend to, you know, incline, it need not come straight like all your other teeth. Okay. So because of that and also it might, you know, press the nerve that is inside your lower jaw which also might cause that mild pain. Okay. So if we, with the x-ray, we can understand the position of your wisdom tooth once. Okay. And also the health of the other teeth as well. And we can also understand the low lying infections or anything that are persisting which will allow me to take a better decision in treating you on the next, I mean what we can do next.

Response: Okay. Okay. So after checking your mouth, I also see that there are stains that are caused due to this habit. And how long have you been smoking, into smoking?
[Emotion: Confirming] [Tone: Neutral]

=== Document ID: 79 ===
User: About 10 years.
Response: 10 years. Okay. So this is the reason why your gums have been affected because of the smoke and the tobacco that has caused damage to your gums. Okay. So the gums started receding. That is going downwards. Okay. So the level of the gums are very lower to the actual position. This is making you know the underlying tissues and bone exposed and also your teeth have become loosened because there is no proper grip. Okay. So to avoid, so right now what you can get is cleaning done, a thorough cleaning done. It might take two sittings because the severity is a little more. (Advising) After cleaning is done, I'll provide you with certain medication and antibiotics which can cause or minimize, you know, the pain and the bleeding that is coming. You also need a change in your toothpaste. Maybe to, you can pick a toothpaste which reduces your sensitivity, which you might tend to have after the scaling is done. Okay. So after two weeks, if the, you know, bleeding still persists, we can get an x-ray to actually understand the level of the bone also because when the gums are receding, even the bone also will get damaged. So these two are to be restored if the pain still persists. Okay. Or else this cleaning will be done and of course the main cause is smoking. So you have to stop smoking. And because this is causing drastic damage to your oral health or teeth and gums.

Response: Okay. So after checking your sugar levels once now, I'd also recommend to get an X-ray done so that I'll understand your bone health. (Explaining) Generally, because of diabetes and also because of your age, the strength of the bone gradually decreases. Okay. But that is a little faster for you because of your... Yeah. ...diabetes. Okay. So with this X-ray, I will also understand that in near future if any other teeth are also getting affected. Okay. (Advising) Initially, we can start with...you can get the scaling done. Okay. Even after scaling is done, your teeth are very loose. (Advising) After two or three weeks, you can come back and we can check them. If they are severely loose, they are to be removed. Okay. (Explaining) If the bone health is good, you can either go for an implant or if the neighboring teeth are strong enough to support, you can have a bridge. Okay. Okay. (Explaining) If both the cases are not possible, you have to get your tooth replaced with some other prosthesis, either removable or fixed thing.

User: Just yesterday, like I said.  It only happened when I ate the ice cream, though.  Before that, nothing.
Response: [Inquiring] [Tone: Neutral]  Okay.  And what kind of ice cream was it?  Was it very cold?  [Assessing]  We need to understand the trigger.
[Emotion: ] [Tone: ]

=== Document ID: 173 ===
User: It was strawberry, pretty cold I guess.  I mean, it was straight from the freezer.
Response: [Clarifying] [Tone: Concerned]  So, very cold ice cream directly from the freezer.  [Diagnosing] That suggests a possible issue with exposed dentin, which is the layer under the enamel.  This is often the cause of tooth sensitivity. [Explaining]  We'll need to examine your teeth to see what's going on.
[Emotion: ] [Tone: ]

=== Document ID: 174 ===
User: Oh, okay.  Does that mean I have a cavity? I'm a little scared.
Response: [Reassuring] [Tone: Friendly] Not necessarily.  Sensitivity doesn't automatically mean a cavity.  [Explaining] There are several reasons why you might have sensitive teeth, including worn enamel, gum recession, or even a cracked tooth.  [Advising]
[Emotion: ] [Tone: ]

=== Document ID: 175 ===
User: It's a sharp, shooting pain, mostly when I bite down on anything hard.  It's not constant, but it's definitely noticeable now.

[Emotion: ] [Tone: ]

=== Document ID: 176 ===
User: Probably a 6 or 7 when it happens.  It's not all the time, thankfully.
Response: (Reassuring) (Informative) That's good to hear it's not constant. (Assessing)  We'll figure out what's causing this. (Questioning)  Have you noticed any sensitivity to hot or cold foods or drinks?
[Emotion: ] [Tone: ]

=== Document ID: 177 ===
User: Yes, actually.  Ice cream is especially painful now.
Response: (Diagnosing) (Concerned) Sensitivity to cold often indicates a problem with the dentin or enamel. (Advising) We need to examine the tooth to determine the exact cause. (Questioning)  Is the pain localized to one specific tooth, or does it seem to radiate?
[Emotion: ] [Tone: ]

=== Document ID: 178 ===
User: It's more of a dull ache, not a sharp pain, if that makes sense.  It's kind of a throbbing feeling.
Response: That makes perfect sense.  A dull, throbbing ache can indicate a different problem than a sharp, stabbing pain. (Clarifying) Can you pinpoint the location of this throbbing ache for me?  (Inquiring)  And how long have you been experiencing this?
[Emotion: Understanding] [Tone: Reassuring]

=== Document ID: 179 ===

=== Document ID: 180 ===
User: Yes, it’s definitely worse when I chew on that side.  And sometimes it’s sensitive to cold drinks.  No swelling though.

[Emotion: Analyzing] [Tone: Informative]

=== Document ID: 181 ===
User: It's really throbbing now, like a dull ache, mostly when I bite down.
Response: (Assessing) I understand.  That throbbing pain when biting suggests it might be related to the pulp of the tooth. We need to examine it carefully to determine the cause. (Inquiring) Can you point to the exact location of the pain?
[Emotion: Concerned] [Tone: Empathetic]

=== Document ID: 182 ===
User: Yeah, right here on the gum near the tooth. It's a bit swollen too.
Response: (Clarifying) So the swelling is localized near the canine tooth? (Inquiring)  Have you noticed any pus or discharge from that area?
[Emotion: Assessing] [Tone: Serious]

=== Document ID: 183 ===
User: I think so, a little bit.  It's hard to tell.
Response: (Advising) It's important we get a good look at that.  (Explaining)  Pus can indicate an infection. (Questioning)  Have you experienced any fever or other symptoms like fatigue?
[Emotion: Concerned] [Tone: Gentle]

=== Document ID: 185 ===
User: Oh, I see.  I guess I haven't been to the dentist in... maybe three years? I've been putting it off.  (Concerned) I'm a bit scared, to be honest.
Response: (Reassuring)  It's okay to feel that way, many people do. (Explaining)  It's much better to address any potential issues early rather than wait until they become more serious and painful. We'll take it slowly and make you comfortable. (Questioning)  Can you tell me a little more about what worries you about going to the dentist?  (Inquiring) And what kind of pain are you experiencing now, exactly?  Is it sharp, dull, constant, or comes and goes?

User: So, how much will all of this cost?
Response: (Assessing)  That's a very valid question.

(Informative) I can give you a rough estimate after the X-ray, but the final cost will be clearer once we assess the state of your bone health and the condition of your teeth.
